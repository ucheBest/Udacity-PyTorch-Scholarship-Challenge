It's used to train deep neural networks using an architecture called convolutional layers.

Using a pre-trained network on images not in the training set is called transfer learning. Here we'll use transfer learning to train a network that can classify our cat and dog photos with near perfect accuracy.\n","\n","With `torchvision.models` you can download these pre-trained networks and use them in your applications.
